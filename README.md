**Web Scraping for Company Information Using Selenium
**
Objective: The project aims to extract and analyze data from websites to gather detailed information about companies, including their names, designations, Company name and industry classifications.

Description: This project leverages Selenium, a web automation tool, to navigate web pages and extract relevant data. The process involves:

**Web Scraping Setup:**

Configure Selenium with the appropriate web driver (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) to interact with web pages.
Implement scripts to handle browser interactions, such as clicking buttons and filling out forms.
Data Extraction:

Identify the target websites where company data is available.
Locate and extract the necessary information, including:
Company Name: The official name of the company.
Designation: The job titles or roles associated with the company.
Industry: The sector or industry in which the company operates.
Data Processing:

Clean and structure the extracted data for further analysis.
Organize the data into a manageable format, such as a DataFrame.
Output:

Export the cleaned data to a CSV file or any other preferred format for subsequent use.
Error Handling and Optimization:

Implement error handling to manage issues like site changes or connection problems.
Optimize the scraping process to improve efficiency and minimize delays.
Tools and Technologies:

Selenium: For web automation and data extraction.
Python: For scripting and data manipulation.
pandas: For data processing and export.
CSV/Excel: For data output and storage.
